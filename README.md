# Occupancy Detection

This repository contains several machine learning models that try to detect whether a room
is occupied.

## Installation

Install requirements:

```
$ pip3 install -r ./requirements.txt
```


## Run

```
$ python3 occupancy_detection.py
```

## TODO:

- Add Linear Discriminant Analysis.
- Add Gradient Boosting Machine.
- Add summary of results.
- State which models have been used in the literature so far.
- Compare these methods with the models that have been used in the literature.
- Suggest ideas for improvement.
