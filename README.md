# Occupancy Detection

This repository contains several machine learning models that try to detect whether a room
is occupied. You can either run the python file or run the jupyter notebook (occupancy_detection.ipynb)

The models that were used: 

* Logistic Regression
* K Nearest Neighbour
* Naive Bayes
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* Support Vector Machine
* Linear Discriminant Analysis
* AdaBoost
* Stacking Classifier

## Installation

Install requirements:

```
$ pip3 install -r ./requirements.txt
```


## Run

```
$ python3 occupancy_detection.py
```
