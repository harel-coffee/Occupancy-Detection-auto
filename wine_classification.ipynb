Here you will use the optimum hyper-parameters you found in step 7 to train the models you selected in stacking. You can try different combinations of classifiers for this purpose. Perform cross-validation and report the same accuracy measures as in step 5. Then train the model on the train set 2 and test on validation set. Report the accuracy measures on validation data."
